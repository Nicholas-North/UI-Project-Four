Project four for UI requires the content of the design to be focused on fixing an issue plaguing the public, and attempting to use user interface designs for good. While there are plenty of issues facing us today, some might say too many to count, one of the example options really stood out to me. To be specific, the one about natural disasters really piqued my interest. This year had me dealing with a couple of environmental scares; from tornado's potentially wreaking it's path through my house or attempting to figure out how my friends in Florida would be faring with Hurricano Milton. Through both of these scenarios: I found myself being frustrated and confused by the lack of clear and authoritative information, which if things had turned out differently could have been life threateningly. This mainly arose from the fact that attempting to google search information like: "Tornado spotted, my area" or "Where is hurricane milton hitting" and "What is the evacuation code for my address: {Insert address here}" would give mixed results. News articles that would give mixed or outdated information, ai-generated responses to definitons that were incorrect, or government websites that gave unhelpful or convoluted information. SPecificically with that last one, there would be multiple government agencies that I'd have to search through ot find the information I want, and all of their website's looked old and outdated. I felt like what I wanted when I searched up these terms was clear, concise information that I could use to figure out what my next steps were, and found myself floundering instead of preparing. Therefore my goal with this project is to create a catch-all website that can help users figure out information about all sort's of natural disasters that could be facing them at a single moment, serving as an amalgamation point for all the different points of data. Since it's a prototype, I'll be focusing more on the design rather than literal function of these services, but I'll try to implement whatever I can with the time alotted.

In order to accomplish this, I plan on doing the following for the design and ideation phase:
- create a survey I can send out to gather information on what people want to see during an emergency
- looking into ui examples of emergency based UI's to see the role of color schemes and component placing
- Use figma to help create digital sketches
